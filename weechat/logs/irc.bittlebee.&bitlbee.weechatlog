2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	Welcome to the BitlBee gateway!
2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	Running BitlBee 3.4.2
2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	If you've never used BitlBee before, please do read the help information using the help command. Lots of FAQs are answered there.
2016-10-06 20:55:18	@root	If you already have an account on this server, just use the identify command to identify yourself.

2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	Welcome to BitlBee, your IRC gateway to ICQ, MSN, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo! and Twitter.
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	The center of BitlBee is the control channel, &bitlbee. Two users will always be there, you (where "you" is the nickname you are using) and the system user, root.
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	You need to register so that all your IM settings (passwords, contacts, etc) can be saved on the BitlBee server. It's important that you pick a good password so no one else can access your account. Register with this password using the register command: register <password> (without the brackets!).
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	Be sure to remember your password. The next time you connect to the BitlBee server you will need to identify <password> so that you will be recognised and logged in to all the IM services automatically.
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:55:50	@root	When finished, type help quickstart2 to continue.

2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	To add an account to the account list you will need to use the account add command: account add <protocol> <username> <password> [<server>].
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	For instance, suppose you have a Jabber account at jabber.org with handle bitlbee@jabber.org with password QuickStart, you would:
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	<you> account add jabber bitlbee@jabber.org QuickStart

2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	Other available IM protocols are msn, oscar, yahoo and twitter. OSCAR is the protocol used by ICQ and AOL. For more information about the account add command, see help account add.
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	 
2016-10-06 20:58:18	@root	When you are finished adding your account(s) use the account on command to enable all your accounts, type help quickstart3 to continue.

2016-10-06 20:59:02	@root	You can now use the /OPER command to enter the password
2016-10-06 20:59:02	@root	Alternatively, enable OAuth if the account supports it: account gtalk set oauth on
2016-10-06 20:59:22	@dnewman	account gtalk set oauth on
2016-10-06 20:59:22	@root	oauth = `on'

2016-10-06 21:03:11	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:03:11	@root	You can omit the password and enter it separately using the IRC /OPER command. This lets you enter your password without your IRC client echoing it on screen or recording it in logs.

2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	Step Five: Chatting.
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	First of all, a person must be on your contact list for you to chat with them (unless it's a group chat, help groupchats for more). If someone not on your contact list sends you a message, simply add them to the proper account with the add command. Once they are on your list and online, you can chat with them in &bitlbee:
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	<you> tux: hey, how's the weather down there?
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	<tux> you: a bit chilly!
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	Note that, although all contacts are in the &bitlbee channel, only tux will actually receive this message. The &bitlbee channel shouldn't be confused with a real IRC channel.
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	If you prefer chatting in a separate window, use the /msg or /query command, just like on real IRC. BitlBee will remember how you talk to someone and show his/her responses the same way. If you want to change the default behaviour (for people you haven't talked to yet), see help set private.
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:19	@root	You know the basics. If you want to know about some of the neat features BitlBee offers, please type help quickstart5.
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@dnewman	help quickstart3
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	Now you might want to add some contacts, to do this we will use the add command. It needs two arguments: a connection ID (which can be a number (try account list), protocol name or (part of) the screenname) and the user's handle. It is used in the following way: add <connection> <handle>
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	<you> add 0 r2d2@example.com

2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	In this case r2d2 is online, since he/she joins the channel immediately. If the user is not online you will not see them join until they log on.
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	Lets say you accidentally added r2d3@example.com rather than r2d2@example.com, or maybe you just want to remove a user from your list because you never talk to them. To remove a name you will want to use the remove command: remove r2d3
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	Finally, if you have multiple users with similar names you may use the rename command to make it easier to remember: rename r2d2_ r2d2_aim
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	 
2016-10-06 21:08:21	@root	When finished, type help quickstart4 to continue.
